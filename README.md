# javascript-challenge

The visualizations are based on the data set for UFO sightings between January 1st and 13th in 2010.
Visualizations were made using JavaScript (D3 library). 
Data filtering works in both cases: when "Filter table" button is pressed, as well as when "enter" button is pushed on the keyboard.

Please see the link to my code [here.](https://github.com/nadiarichards/javascript-challenge/blob/main/UFO-level-1/static/js/app.js) 

## Menthods and languages used:

1. JavaScript
2. D3 library
3. HTML for writing the code for the webpage
4. CSS for styling on the page

Please see the screenshots below.
